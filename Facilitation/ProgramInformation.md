# PEEKE Internship: Program Information
Hyland has been offering this internship through Y.O.U. since 2021, and the program has evolved significantly since then.

## Y.O.U. - Youth Opportunities Unlimited
[Youth Opportunities Unlimited](https://youcle.org/) is a nonprofit workforce development organization based in Cleveland, Ohio. For over 40 years Y.O.U. has served teens and young adults ages 14-24 living in under-resourced areas in Northeast Ohio. Their mission is to prepare teens and young adults to become economically self-sufficient contributors to building Northeast Ohioâ€™s educated, skilled, and inclusive workforce. Their vision is a just and equitable community where every young person is ready and confidently pursuing a meaningful future.

## PEEKE - Partnerships, Exploration, Experience, Knowledge, Excellence
The [PEEKE Internship Program](https://www.youcle.org/stories/2019/1/peeke-yous-new-internship-program) places high school students with Northeast Ohio companies for summer internships. These students are rising juniors and seniors with a GPA of at least 3.0 located in Cuyahoga County or Lorain County. Interns are required to complete 120 hours of work, and Y.O.U. pays them a stipend based on the hours they complete.

## History @ Hyland
Hyland has partnered with Y.O.U. in some capacity since 2020, and has offered a PEEKE internship since 2021 through the Tech Outreach team.

### 2021
This was the first year we offered a PEEKE internship. It was conducted entirely virtually. We had two groups: two students focused on learning basic web development skills, and four students worked on building a software project from scratch. We learned a lot! Mainly:

- It's really hard to do a virtual internship
- It's hard for high schoolers to design/architect a project from scratch

### 2022
The second time around, we made some significant adjustments. We offered the internship hybrid; some time in-person, some virtual. We had THREE groups: two students focusing on learning basic web development skills and helping facilitate another one of our programs, four students working on a project for the Tech Outreach team, and four students working on a project for an external stakeholder. Once again, we learned a lot:

- Ten students is a lot of students - each group received less attention than they needed
  - Juggling multiple summer programs also contributed to this difficulty
- The students who were just learning did not feel as fulfilled
- Working with an external stakeholder made the stakes very high
- The products did not end up being usable - there was not enough understanding of requirements ahead of time
- Hybrid work was still incredibly difficult - the team that spent more time in the office was significantly more successful

### 2023
The third and most recent time we offered the internship was 2023. This iteration was the most successful by far. We had one group: five students working on one software project. For more information about the project, checkout [this blog post](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OCE/blog/2023/09/19/838992339/Introducing...+Friendivia). Through this, we learned a lot again:

- Investing a lot of time focusing on one group/one project paid off big time
- Pre-planning the project, and even building out a semi-functional version of the product ahead of time, made it much easier to get started
- Being in-person for almost the entire time helped the team gel and work much better together
- Active development from Joseph made it possible to have a finished product by the end of the summer
- Selecting only students with previous coding experience ensured they were ready to tackle the project

The biggest takeaway from our previous experience is that an intern team needs someone fully dedicated to their success. That's why it's so important that we find a co-lead or two, and why we will not feel confident offering the internship if we do not have one.
