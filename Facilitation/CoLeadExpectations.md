# PEEKE Internship: Technical Co-Lead Expectations
In order successfully facilitate a high school internship this summer, the Tech Outreach team will need significant help. YOU have the opportunity to lead the development of a fun and sophisticated software project, all while having a tremendous impact on the lives of five high school students!

Co-leads will be required this time because I (Joseph Maxwell) will be on sabbatical in **July 2024**. We'll need one or two folks to cover my responsibilities during that time, and take part in the project from its conception. Here are a few quick facts:

- Because of the large scale, manager buy-in will be of the utmost importance.
- This will require time spent in the Westlake office - we have found that the internship is exponentially more successful when students and mentors are able to work together in-person.
- The specific project has yet to be determined - but it will be good.
- Strong programming skills are required.

## Program Information

## Before the Summer
In the months before the interns join us on site, we will be:

- deciding on a project
- building out the initial architecture for the project
- gathering learning resources
- planning introductory meetings

Joseph will be primarily responsible for the technical aspects of this planning; the co-lead(s) should be present and involved in the process to the point that they can successfully take over for him when I'm gone. They should have a solid understanding of the project and the technologies.

No in-person time will be required for this portion of the program.

## During the Internship
The hope is that we hit the ground running on development soon after the interns arrive. There will likely be a few kick-off meetings, and a little time for interns to learn asynchronously before diving into the code, but after that, it's all project work.

### Before Joseph's Sabbatical
While Joseph is still working, co-leads will mainly be attending meetings, monitoring the codebase, and guiding students as needed. **This will require some time spent in the office with the students.** Demonstrating an interest and authority over the project before Joseph is gone will ensure a seamless transition.

The co-lead(s) should establish a solid working relationship with the interns during this time. We will all participate in activities designed to aid this team-building.

### During Joseph's Sabbatical
This is the real big ask. Joseph will be out of the office from July 8th through August 2nd. The interns will rely on the co-lead(s) for all technical guidance, and potentially even for some aspects of project management. It is possible that they are up-and-running as an autonomous team by this time period, but they also may need a LOT of help. Responsibilities may include:

- Conducting daily stand-ups (likely Tue/Wed/Thu)
- Conducting other meetings (e.g., sprint plannings, retrospectives, demos, UX reviews)
- Performing code reviews and merging pull requests
- Keeping track of project tickets/issues, delegating work
- Checking Discord regularly for any asynchronous work
- Checking GitHub regularly for any code changes
- Explaining parts of the code to the interns
- Directing interns to resources to help them code
- Showing interns how to complete their work if needed
- Ensuring interns are working effectively
- Answering architectural questions
- Making decisions about the future of the project
- Supervising students in the Hyland Labs room for ~20h/week
- Maintaining a fun in-office environment

All of this really boils down to complete ownership of the project during these four weeks. Depending on the number of co-leads, this could be a ~20hour/week commitment. It's a huge undertaking, but based on our past experience with internships like these, the investment is absolutely worth it.

## Monthly Plan
This is all subject to change, but the commitment will look something like this each month:

| Timeframe | Description | Time Required |
|-|-|-|
| February | Help choose a project | 30min/week |
| March | Help determine technologies & define architecture | 30min/week |
| April | Help develop foundational code for the project | 1h/week |
| May | Help plan meetings, continue development | 1h/week |
| June | Attend meetings, monitor repository, mentor students | 2h/week* |
| July | Lead meetings, own the codebase, supervise/guide students in-office | 20h/week* OR 10h/week* |
| August | Provide guidance as available | 1h/week |

>*June and July will require time spent _in the office_ with the students

The time commitment in July will depend on the number of co-leads. If there is only one co-lead available, the time required will be higher.

## Conclusion
The work required is substantial, but the impact is substantial as well. These students will gain real-world software development experience in a safe and welcoming environment, while working on an interesting, valuable, appropriately-scoped project - and YOU have a chance to make that happen!

If we are not able to find technical co-leads for this summer, we will be unable to offer the internship. Please consider helping us
