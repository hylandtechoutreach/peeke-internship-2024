# Idle Hacker
An incremental game where you try to gather as much data as you can. If you're feeling lazy and you don't want to collect it bit by bit, you can write code to hack the game and speed up the process!

This game is designed to help students explore introductory programming concepts while they compete to see who can grab the most data.

## Skills
Coming into the project, team members should have a solid foundation of programming skills, as well as the right mindset to jump in and start learning and contributing.

### Prerequisites
In order to be successful with this project, a team member should have some combination of these skills:

- Java (AP CS A or similar)
- JavaScript (Hy-Tech Club Web 103 or similar)
- Full-stack experience in any language
- Personal development project experience
- Professionalism
- Determination
- Ability to learn
- Ability to function well on a team

### Experience & Growth
Through this project, there will hopefully be several challenges - which are fantastic opportunities to grow!

- Git & GitHub - version control & open-source contribution
- TypeScript
- A wide variety of frameworks
- Game development
- Progressive web application development
- Full-stack web development
- Continuous deployment
- Agile methodology & team-based development

Ultimately, this experience will be as close to a real-world development team environment as possible. The ultimate success of the project will be up to the team members - this is a hefty responsibility, but the ownership will make it even more rewarding and impactful.

## Technology Stack
All of these tools are subject to change, but based on research and some past experience, they should be a good way to begin.

### Front-End
The front-end will be a Mobile-first [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps). This will allow for a similar experience to a native mobile application, but ease the development process and cross-platform support.

There is a [template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react-ts) that should serve as a decent starting point, using these technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Phaser](https://phaser.io) game development framework
- [React](https://react.dev) front-end framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) build tool

### Back-End
The back-end will be less critical, but based on the long-term vision of this project, it will be important to set it up from the beginning. Using the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack), a well-used and well-documented combination of frameworks, should make this relatively straightforward. Authentication will be an important aspect in the future as well.

There is a [template](https://github.com/bradtraversy/mern-auth) that should provide a solid way to start up a simple authentication-ready application, using these technologies:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the web framework
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) for the back-end runtime environment

For back-end TypeScript support, [this template](https://github.com/GabrielSalangsang013/ts-mern-with-auth-boilerplate) may also be useful.

## Software Development Process
The team will follow a simplified [agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) process. Daily stand-ups, bi-weekly sprint planning and retrospective meetings, and [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)-style issue tracking will be the primary implementation of this methodology.

The codebase, as well as all project issues, will be hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/). Once the project has been initialized, team members will clone it, work on their assigned issues within short-lived development branches, and submit their work for code review through pull requests - following a version of [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development).

The plan is to deploy this web application through [Render](https://render.com/).

### Mentorship
As the project gets off the ground, mentors will be responsible for these roles:

- Scrum mastery
- Product ownership
- Technical guidance
- Code review
- Repository management
- Active development
- Team member management

As the project continues, there may be less need for mentor involvement.

### Teamwork
Team members will help prioritize issues, come up with new issues, delegate tasks, and work together to effectively and efficiently complete the development of the game. Team members will be encouraged to practice pair programming, and help each other as much as possible. All team members will be responsible for assuring the quality of the application through testing. Team communication will take place on [Discord](https://discord.com/).

The ultimate goal is for the team to become fully autonomous, with the mentors available simply for support.

## Skeleton Application
Before the team members arrive, the hope is that there will be a solid starting point for the game. Team members should NOT be responsible for the architecture of the application. Hopefully, they will be able to work on the "fun" stuff - developing new features, debugging any problems, and designing the gameplay.

Project mentors will work on this development prior to the project kick-off. It should have all the bones, but that should be it - it should be the bare minimum.

### Getting Started
As part of the skeleton application project development, a "Getting Started" guide will also be developed. This will include information about:

- Environment setup
- GitHub setup
- MongoDB Atlas database setup
- Cloning and running the project
- Selected tutorials to learn project technologies
- Codebase explanations

There may be more required as well.

## Design
All team members should be involved with the design of the game. This may include building wireframes with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), creating art assets, defining the user experience, and anything else!

To be successful will require more than just solid programming - team members will have to contribute in plenty of other ways! This could include business planning like marketing, promotion, and branding, or other big picture strategizing that goes beyond the code.

## Copyright
All team members will be listed as copyright holders for the application codebase.
