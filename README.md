# Hyland + PEEKE 2024
Welcome to the 2024 PEEKE Internship program at Hyland!

## Project Description & Expected Outcomes
Through our partnership with [Youth Opportunities Unlimited](https://www.youcle.org/), five high school interns from Northeast Ohio have been placed at Hyland for the duration of the summer. They will work as a team to develop TODO: PROJECT DECISION. TODO: PROJECT DESCRIPTION. By taking part in the software development lifecycle, these interns will gain invaluable technical knowledge, as well as practical experience working with stakeholders, handling product management, crafting user experiences, and more. By the end of the summer, they will have built a product that is valuable to them and us, and they will be well on their way to successful careers as software developers.
