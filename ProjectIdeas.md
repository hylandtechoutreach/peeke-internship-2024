# 2024 Project Ideas
These are some high-level ideas for projects. Once a project is selected, we will fill in the details.

## Idle Coding Game
This would be an [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game), similar to [Cookie Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker) or [AdVenture Capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdVenture_Capitalist), but players would have to solve coding puzzles to get points. This could help us gamify the computer science education we offer in order to reach students in a more engaging way.

### Stack
Incremental games are often mobile applications - so that could be an option for this. Another option would be a web application - potentially a [progressive web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app).

Architectural work will be required, but it may not have to be too complex.

### Feasibility
In its simplest form, this could be a front-end website with some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (like [Candy Box](https://candybox2.github.io/candybox/)). This will make it much easier to "complete" the project to a satisfactory degree, even if it is not full-featured and robust.

## Friendivia Continuation
A continuation of the [Friendivia project](https://github.com/hto-projects/friendivia) from the summer of 2023.

### Stack
Already determined to be MongoDB, React, Node, Express, and Sockets. No architecture work will be required.

### Feasibility
Definitely feasible - would require less overhead work other than feature prioritization.

## Student Database - New
A revisiting of the student database project from the summer of 2022. That project was not setup for long-term success, but this would be.

### Stack
To create this CRUD app, a web application would likely make the most sense - probably a MERN stack application.

### Feasibility
With enough developer work, this should be feasible. May be some challenges with authentication. For us to actually use this, we may need to jump through some legal hoops to store real live student data.

This would be a much more substantial project, but it could be extraordinarily impactful for the Tech Outreach team. Much less fun, and fewer opportunities for creativity.

## Community Hub
A central place online for our team to share resources, perhaps host websites, and perhaps allow students to connect.

### Stack
This would likely be another CRUD app type of thing, so MERN would be a good stack.

### Feasibility
This would also require work from the authentication side of things. May be worth pursuing, but may not have as big of an impact, even if successful. A bit lower of stakes, but high ceiling.

## Other Existing Open Source Projects
Find some cool open source projects to which the interns could contribute. This could be more "real" than one of our home-grown projects, but because of that, the stakes would be higher and the process may be more difficult.

### Stack
Potentially any stack.

### Feasibility
Finding a good project or set of projects would be the tough part, but fitting into the larger open source ecosystem could be hugely beneficial
